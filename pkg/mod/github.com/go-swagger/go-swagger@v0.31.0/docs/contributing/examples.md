# Contributing examples

`go-swagger` use cases are illustrated by a lot of running examples, provided here:
https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/examples.

Whenever code generation rules change, we feel it is important to maintain
all the generated code provided as examples.

The script `./hack/regen-samples.sh` does just that.

Don't forget to update this script when you add a new example.
