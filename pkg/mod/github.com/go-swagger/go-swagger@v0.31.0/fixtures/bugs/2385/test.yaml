  title: "external types imports: external anonymous types"
  description: |
    This sample specification exercises external types, with both x-go-type in definitions and inlined.

    It demonstrates how to use the x-go-type extension to plug external type definitions in the generated code,
    for models (e.g. for properties, arrays or maps) or operations.

    Notice that x-go-type works for schemas and is not supported for simple swagger types,
    used for response headers and query & path parameters.

  NoValidateExternal:
    description: |

      This type demonstrates how we can disable validation for an external type.

      This is useful if you want to reuse some types from the standard library and don't
      want to resort to an embedded type.

    type: object
    x-go-type:
      type: Request
      import:
        package: net/http
      hints:
        noValidation: true

  ObjectWithNoValidate:
    description: |
      A reference to the NoValidateExternal external type.

      If the "noValidation" hint is omitted in the definition above, this code won't build because `http.Request` has no `Validate` method.

    type: object
    required: [ myMandatoryRequest ]
    properties:
      myRequest:
        $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidateExternal'
      myMandatoryRequest:
        $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidateExternal'

  ArrayWithNoValidate:
    description: |
      A slice of NoValidateExternal external types.

      If the "noValidation" hint is omitted in the definition above, this code won't build because `http.Request` has no `Validate` method.

    type: array
    maxItems: 12
    uniqueItems: true
    items:
      $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidateExternal'

  MapWithNoValidate:
    description: |
      A map of NoValidateExternal external types.

      If the "noValidation" hint is omitted in the definition above, this code won't build because `http.Request` has no `Validate` method.

    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidateExternal'

  TupleWithNoValidate:
    description: |
      A tuple of NoValidateExternal external types.

      If the "noValidation" hint is omitted in the definition above, this code won't build because `http.Request` has no `Validate` method.

      Notice that "additionalItems" is not a construct that pass swagger validation,
      but is supported by go-swagger.

    type: array
    items:
    - $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidateExternal'
    - $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidateExternal'
    additionalItems:
      $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidateExternal'

  NoValidatePrimitive:
    description: |

      This type demonstrates how we can disable validation for an external primitive type.

    type: integer
    x-go-type:
      type: Duration
      import:
        package: time
      hints:
        noValidation: true

  MapOfPrimitives:
    description: |
      A map of NoValidatePrimitive external types.

      If the "noValidation" hint is omitted in the definition above, this code won't build because `time.Duration` has no `Validate` method.

    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      $ref: '#/definitions/NoValidatePrimitive'
