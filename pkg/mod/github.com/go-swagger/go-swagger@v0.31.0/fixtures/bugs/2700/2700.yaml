         Filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
         Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
         Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

         TODO: how do we prevent errors in the filesystem from compromising the machine
