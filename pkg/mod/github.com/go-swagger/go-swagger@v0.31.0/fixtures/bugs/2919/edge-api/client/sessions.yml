      summary: List sessions
      description: |
        Retrieves a list of active sessions resources; supports filtering, sorting, and pagination.

        Sessions are tied to an API session and are moved when an API session times out or logs out. Active sessions
        (i.e. Ziti SDK connected to an edge router) will keep the session and API session marked as active.
