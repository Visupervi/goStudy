  PortBinding:
    description: |
      PortBinding represents a binding between a host IP address and a host
      port.
    type: "object"
    properties:
      HostIp:
        description: "Host IP address that the container's port is mapped to."
        type: "string"
        example: "127.0.0.1"
      HostPort:
        description: "Host port number that the container's port is mapped to."
        type: "string"
        example: "4443"

  PortMap:
    description: |
      PortMap describes the mapping of container ports to host ports, using the
      container's port-number and protocol as key in the format `<port>/<protocol>`,
      for example, `80/udp`.

      If a container's port is mapped for multiple protocols, separate entries
      are added to the mapping table.
